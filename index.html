                <p class="hide">Meat: this recipe uses a whole bone-in goat leg (mbuzi) but other cuts such as spare ribs will also do.<br>
                    Vegetables: fresh ginger, garlic, onion and, bird eye chillis (optional)..<br>
                    Spices: cumin, paprika, and stock cubes..<br>
                    Fruit: lemon juice (easily substitutable with lime juice)..<br>
                    Condiments: cooking oil and salt..<br>
                    HOW TO MARINATE GOAT MEAT.<br>
                    Meat with marinade on top in preparation for grilling.<br>
                    Add the marinade.<br>
                    Okay, I will admit that marinating goat meat may sound like an extra step that you would rather skip, <br>
                    but trust me on this one,. as this step will certainly enhance the flavors. <br>
                    I can tell you for certain that there is no looking back, once you get accustomed to marinating your food before cooking.
